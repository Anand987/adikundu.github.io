                              This portfolio features a few design projects that I have undertaken for several
                              college
                              teams and aspirational startups while pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer
                              Science.

                              Working within such modest organizations comprising of dedicated individuals using ab
                              all-hands-on-desk type of approach to things, I was introduced to multitude of
                              approaches
                              and technologies as I tried to find my way through them.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              A core part of my design approach is to experience absorbed by the audience. Even the
                              most
                              transient of interaction have the potential to excite the user.

                              Those little moments of delight are what truly make a product successful and are
                              exactly
                              the details that I have tried to explain within the showcased projects.

                          In addition to my work, this website is meant to exhibit my personality as I percieve it to
                          be. The site is filled with fun and quirky elements and language that I unapologetically
                          use and adhere to.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          I also absolutly love to play video games. <b><em> Experiencing</em></b> stories rather
                          than reading, listening or hearing them is an irreplacable experience.

                          Following that, the website is also filled with several interactive Easter Eggs that I urge
                          all viewers to discover and enjoy!
