                          Most of these departmental associations’ logos lack a certain sense of originality. They
                          conform to a standard template followed by amateurly executed ‘tech’ logos- sharp edges,
                          blue overlays and digital circuitry.

                      <p>
                          They often highlight a certain element of the department’s study, like microprocessor
                          circuits.

                          After initial interviews of my fellow CSE undergrads, their message became clear stating
                          that Computer Science, as a field, is too expansive to be represented by one visual motif.
                          Hence, a <span class="has-text-weight-bold">pattern library was created to be the essence
                              of the identity.</span>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          Each core pattern of this identity represents a certain part of Computer Science; which is
                          present in our curriculum and taught on a daily basis.

                          This dynamic pattern library also serves as the reminder of continuous change in the
                          organisation. As seniors graduate and freshermen join CSEA each year, the core team of the
                          organisation is created anew annually.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          This is also parallel to the dynamism of CS as an academic field itself. Core curriculum
                          subjects such as Data Structures and Algorithms, will be accompanied by electives such as
                          Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in the upcoming years. These core patterns can
                          be
                          supplanted by those designed by the newer generation of students which represent their
                          fields
                          of interest.

                              <p>- A growth of 40% on the likes of the Facebook page of CSEA over the academic year
                                  2017-18.</p>
                              <p>- This academic year’s events have received an approximate total of 840 participants
                                  across 4 different competitions and fests.
                              </p>
                              <p>- The revamped branding allowed for an increase in sponsorship tie-ups with
                                  companies such as McDonald’s, Red Bull and HackerRank; drastically improving over
                                  organizations in the previous year.</p>
                              <p>- The ID card lanyard design proved to be massively popular amongst students and was
                                  successful in creating the ‘marketing hype’ that it was designed for.</p>
